# Haskell Exercises for UPenn CIS 194 (Spring 2013)

As [recommended by Chris Allen](https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell), coauthor of the [Haskell Book](http://haskellbook.com), I'm working through the University of Pennsylvania [CIS 194 (Spring 2013) lectures and homework](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html) to brush up on Haskell. This repository is my solutions to the homework.

I've tried to follow the class [style guide](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/docs/style.pdf). However, the function names provided and requested are often shorter than I'd like.
